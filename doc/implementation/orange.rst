ORANGE
======

The ORANGE (Oak Ridge Advanced Nested Geometry Engine) package is currently
under development as the version in SCALE is ported to GPU.

Geometry creation
-----------------

ORANGE geometry can be constructed from multiple geometry representations,
including Geant4 HEP geometry.

CSG unit
^^^^^^^^

The CSG *unit* is a general scene comprising arbitrary volumes made of arbitrary
quadric faces. The name "unit" is derived from the KENO criticality safety
code, where a unit is a reusable composable building block for arrays.

Each unit is constructed from the user defining ``ObjectInterface``
implementations and relationships, and specifying which of them are volumes.
The Object interface is implemented by:

Shape
   A finite (and usually convex) region of space defined by the intersection of
   multiple quadric surfaces. The Shape is implemented using a single
   IntersectRegion,
   which is an implementation that builds the underlying surfaces and bounding
   boxes. Shapes should be as simple as possible, aligned along and centered on
   the Z axis.
Solid
   A shape that's hollowed out and/or has a slice removed. It is equivalent to
   a CSG operation on two shapes of the same type and an azimuthal wedge.
PolySolid
   A union of transformed solids along the Z axis, which can also be hollowed
   and sliced azimuthally.
Transformed
   Applies a transform to another CSG object.
AnyObjects, AllObjects, and NegatedObject
   Apply the CSG operations of union, intersection, and negation. The first two
   are implemented as templates of a JoinObjects class.

Objects are typically constructed and used as shared pointers so that they can
be reused in multiple locations.

CSG unit construction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Object classes above are all factory functions for creating a CSG tree and
transformed surfaces corresponding to leaf nodes. Some important aspects of
this construction process are:

- Transforming constructed surfaces based on the stack of transformations
- Simplifying and normalizing surfaces (e.g., ensuring planes are pointing in a
  "positive" direction and converting arbitrary planes to axis-aligned planes)
- Deduplicating "close" surfaces to eliminate boundary crossing errors
- Naming constructed surfaces based on the constructing surface type
- Constructing bounding boxes using the original and simplified surfaces, as
  well as additional specifications from the convex regions
- Adding surfaces as leaf nodes to the CSG tree, and defining additional nodes
  based on those
- Simplifying the CSG tree based on boundary conditions and other factors

Geant4 geometry translation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Geant4 geometry is a hierarchy of "logical volumes" comprised of solids.
Child ("daughter") volumes are "placed" into a parent ("mother") volume after
applying a transformation (translation, rotation, reflection, or a
combination), displacing the material in the parent volume. Besides this
displacement, no overlap is allowed.

Solids are parametrized volumes that may be hollowed out, have slices removed,
or be defined as a CSG operation on placed volumes. They are sometimes but not
always convex. See the `Geant4 documentation`_ for descriptions of all the
predefined solids.

A logical volume can be referenced multiple times, i.e., placed multiple times in
multiple different volumes. The Geant4-ORANGE converter decomposes the graph of
logical volume relationships into subgraphs that
each become a CSG unit. This decomposition is currently tuned so that:

- Volumes with no children are directly placed as "material" leaf nodes into a
  unit
- Logical volumes placed in a singular location without transforms are also
  placed as materials with child volumes explicitly subtracted out
- Union or poly volumes (for now!) must be placed as materials even if they are
  used multiple times and have daughter volumes.
