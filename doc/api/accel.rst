Acceleritas
===========

The ``accel`` directory contains components exclusive to coupling Celeritas
with Geant4 for user-oriented integration. See :ref:`example_geant_full` for a
detailed example of how to use Celeritas to offload EM tracks to GPU and
dispatch hits back to Geant4 sensitive detectors. The simpler interface for
multithreaded or serial applications is demonstrated in
:ref:`example_geant_minimal`.

High-level interface
--------------------

The SimpleOffload class is an extremely easy-to-use interface for
offloading tracks to Celeritas in a multithreaded or serial application. The
class names correspond to user actions and ActionInitialization. It requires a
few app-owned pieces such as SharedParams and LocalTransporter to be owned by
the calling application; the options described below must also be set up and
provided.

.. doxygenclass:: celeritas::SimpleOffload

Celeritas setup
---------------

The setup options help translate the Geant4 physics and problem setup to
Celeritas. They are also necessary to set up the GPU offloading
characteristics. Future versions of Celeritas will automate more of these
settings.

.. doxygenstruct:: celeritas::SDSetupOptions

.. doxygenclass:: celeritas::UniformAlongStepFactory

Detailed interface
------------------

These classes are usually integrated into UserActions. The ``SimpleOffload``
interface above hides the complexity of these classes, or for more complex
applications you can choose to use these classes directly instead of it.
