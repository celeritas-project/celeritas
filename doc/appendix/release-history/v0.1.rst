Version 0.1.5
=============

*Release date: 2023/02/19*

Version 0.1.5 corrects several major tracking and physics bugs
in the 0.1.x series. Notably:

- Positron annihilation is no longer ignored.
- The 1 keV standard EM physics cutoff applies to electrons and positrons
  *after* slowing down in addition to before, reducing the number of
  low-energy particles being tracked.
- Field propagation no longer advances particles to boundaries slightly
  past their physics path length. This previously produced numerous
  instances of a coincident boundary crossing plus physics interaction.
- In high-Z materials, Geant4 produces MSC cross sections for positrons
  that are not monotonically decreasing with increasing energy (there is
  a discontinuity around 10 MeV). This behavior previously caused a
  miscalculation of the step length when slowing down near 10 MeV.

Version 0.1.0
=============

*Released 2022/07/31*

"Initial viable product" release of Celeritas. This release is focused on unit
testing and stabilizing the API for exploratory use by downstream applications
and frameworks. Some initial code verification problems (looking at energy and
step distributions for simple problems such as TestEM3) are promising, but the
code is far from validated.

New features
------------

- Standard EM physics including multiple scattering and energy loss
  fluctuations
- VecGeom for GDML navigation, ORANGE for testing
- Support for CUDA, HIP, and CPU (with and without OpenMP)
- Magnetic field support with runtime-swappable field types

Known bugs
----------

- Magnetic field propagation can fail at geometry boundaries, especially with
  ORANGE.
- Multiple scattering requires more steps than expected compared to Geant4.
