Dependencies
============

Celeritas is built using modern CMake_. It has multiple dependencies to operate
as a full-featured code, but each dependency can be individually disabled as
needed.

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org

The code requires external dependencies to build with full functionality.
However, any combination of these requirements can be omitted to enable
limited development on experimental HPC systems or personal machines with
fewer available components.

Ideally you will build Celeritas with all dependencies to gain the full
functionality of the code, but there are circumstances in which you may not
have (or want) all the dependencies or features available. By default, the CMake code in
Celeritas queries available packages and sets several
``CELERITAS_USE_{package}``
options based on what it finds, so you have a good chance of successfully
configuring Celeritas on the first go. Some optional features
will error out in the configure if their required
dependencies are missing, but they will update the CMake cache variable so that
the next configure will succeed (with that component disabled).

Toolchain installation
======================

The recommended way to install dependencies is with ``Spack``,
an HPC-oriented package manager that includes numerous scientific packages,
including those used in HEP. Celeritas includes a Spack environment at
:file:`scripts/spack.yaml` that describes the code's full suite
of dependencies (including testing and documentation). To install these
dependencies:

- Clone and load Spack following its `getting started instructions
  <https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_.
- If using CUDA: run ``spack external find cuda`` to inform Spack of the existing
  installation
- Create the Celeritas development environment with ``spack env create
  celeritas scripts/spack.yaml``.
- Tell Spack to default to building with CUDA support with
  the command ``spack -e celeritas config add packages:all:variants:"cxxstd=17 +cuda
  cuda_arch=<ARCH>"``, where ``<ARCH>`` is the numeric portion of the
  `CUDA architecture flags
  <https://arnon.dk/matching-sm-architectures-arch-and-gencode-for-various-nvidia-cards/>`_.
- Install all the dependencies with ``spack -e celeritas install``.

The current Spack environment for full-featured development is:

.. literalinclude:: ../../scripts/spack.yaml
   :language: yaml

With this environment (with CUDA enabled), all Celeritas tests should be
enabled and all should pass. Celeritas is build-compatible with older versions
of some dependencies (e.g., Geant4@10.6 and VecGeom@1.2.2), but some tests may
fail, indicating a change in behavior or a bug fix in that package.
Specifically, older versions of VecGeom have shapes and configurations that are
incompatible on GPU with new CMS detector descriptions.

Building Celeritas
==================

Once the Celeritas Spack environment has been installed, set your shell's environment
variables (``PATH``, ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, ...) by activating it.

To clone the latest development version of Celeritas:

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas.git

or download it from the GitHub-generated `zip file`_.

, you can configure, build, and test using the provided helper script:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd celeritas
   $ spack env activate celeritas
   $ ./scripts/build.sh base

or manually with:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd celeritas
   $ spack env activate celeritas
   $ mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake ..
   $ make && ctest

.. _zip file: https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas/archive/refs/heads/develop.zip

CMake Presets
=============

To manage multiple builds with different
configure options (debug or release, VecGeom or ORANGE), you can use the
CMake presets provided by Celeritas via the ``CMakePresets.json`` file for CMake
3.21 and higher:

.. code-block:: console

   $ cmake --preset=default

The three main options are "minimal", "default", and "full", which all set
different expectations for available dependencies.

.. note::

   If your CMake version is too old, you may get an unhelpful message:

   .. code-block:: console

      CMake Error: Could not read presets from celeritas: Unrecognized "version"
      field

   which is just a poor way of saying the version in the ``CMakePresets.json``
   file is newer than that version knows how to handle.

If you want to add your own set of custom options and flags, create a
``CMakeUserPresets.json`` file or, if you wish to contribute on a regular
basis, create a preset at :file:`scripts/cmake-presets/{HOSTNAME}.json` and
call ``scripts/build.sh {preset}`` to create the symlink, configure the preset,
build, and test. See :file:`scripts/README.md` in the code repository for more
details.
