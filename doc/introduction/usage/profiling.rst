Profiling
---------

Since the primary motivator of Celeritas is performance on GPU hardware,
profiling is a necessity. Celeritas uses NVTX (CUDA),  ROCTX (HIP) or Perfetto (CPU)
to annotate the different sections of the code, allowing for fine-grained
profiling and improved visualization.

Timelines
^^^^^^^^^

A detailed timeline of the Celeritas construction, steps, and kernel launches
can be gathered using `NVIDIA Nsight systems`_.

.. _NVIDIA Nsight systems: https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/UserGuide/index.html

Here is an example using the ``celer-sim`` app to generate a timeline:

.. sourcecode::
   :linenos:

   $ CELER_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 \
   > nsys profile \
   > -c nvtx  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt
   > -p celer-sim@celeritas
   > --osrt-backtrace-stack-size=16384 --backtrace=fp
   > -f true -o report.qdrep \
   > celer-sim inp.json

To use the NVTX ranges, you must enable the ``CELER_ENABLE_PROFILING`` variable
and use the NVTX "capture" option (lines 1 and 3). The ``celer-sim`` range in
the ``celeritas`` domain (line 4) enables profiling over the whole application.
Additional system backtracing is specified in line 5; line 6 writes (and
overwrites) to a particular output file; the final line invokes the
application.

Timelines can also be generated on AMD hardware using the ROCProfiler_
applications. Here's an example that writes out timeline information:

.. sourcecode::
   :linenos:

   $ CELER_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 \
   > rocprof \
   > --roctx-trace \
   > --hip-trace \
   > celer-sim inp.json

.. _ROCProfiler: https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/rocprofiler/en/latest/rocprofv1.html#roctx-trace

It will output a :file:`results.json` file that contains profiling data for
both the Celeritas annotations (line 3) and HIP function calls (line 4) in
a "trace event format" which can be viewed in the Perfetto_ data visualization
tool.

.. _Perfetto: https://ui.perfetto.dev/

On CPU, timelines are generated using Perfetto. It is only supported when CUDA
and HIP are disabled. Perfetto supports application-level and system-level profiling.
To use the application-level profiling, set the ``tracing_file`` input key.

.. sourcecode::
   :linenos:

   $ CELER_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 \
   > celer-sim inp.json

The system-level profiling, capturing both system and application events,
requires starting external services. To use this mode, the ``tracing_file`` key must
be absent or empty. Details on how to setup the system services can be found in
the `Perfetto documentation`_. Root access on the system is required.

If you integrate celeritas in your application, you need to create a ``TracingSession``
instance. The profiling session will end when the object goes out of scope but it can be
moved to extend its lifetime.

.. sourcecode:: cpp
   :linenos:

   #include "TracingSession.hh"

   int main()
   {
      // system-level profiling, pass a filename to use application-level profiling
      TracingSession session;
      session.start()
   }

.. _Perfetto documentation: https://perfetto.dev/docs/quickstart/linux-tracing

Kernel profiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Detailed kernel diagnostics including occupancy and memory bandwidth can be
gathered with the `NVIDIA Compute systems`_ profiler.

.. _NVIDIA Compute systems: https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/NsightComputeCli/index.html

This example gathers kernel statistics for 10 "propagate" kernels (for both
charged and uncharged particles) starting with the 300th launch.

.. sourcecode::
   :linenos:

   $ CELER_ENABLE_PROFILING=1 \
   > ncu \
   > --nvtx --nvtx-include "celeritas@celer-sim/step/*/propagate" \
   > --launch-skip 300 --launch-count 10 \
   > -f -o propagate
   > celer-sim inp.json

It will write to :file:`propagate.ncu-rep` output file. Note that the domain
and range are flipped compared to ``nsys`` since the kernel profiling allows
detailed top-down stack specification.
