@article{Valassi-Using,
	abstract = {Benchmarking of {CPU} resources in {WLCG} has been based on the {HEP}-{SPEC}06 ({HS}06) suite for over a decade. It has recently become clear that {HS}06, which is based on real applications from non-{HEP} domains, no longer describes typical {HEP} workloads. The aim of the {HEP}-Benchmarks project is to develop a new benchmark suite for {WLCG} compute resources, based on real applications from the {LHC} experiments. By construction, these new benchmarks are thus guaranteed to have a score highly correlated to the throughputs of {HEP} applications, and a {CPU} usage pattern similar to theirs. Linux containers and the {CernVM}-{FS} filesystem are the two main technologies enabling this approach, which had been considered impossible in the past. In this paper, we review the motivation, implementation and outlook of the new benchmark suite.},

@article{Tanabashi2018-Review,
	abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 2,873 new measurements from 758 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 118 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on Neutrinos in Cosmology. Starting with this edition, the Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and all review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings. Review articles that were previously part of the Listings are now included in volume 1. The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is also available.},

	abstract = {The ATLAS experiment, operational at the new LHC collider, is fully simulated using a Geant 4-based simulation program within the ATLAS Athena framework. This simulation software is used for large-scale production of events on the LHC Computing Grid as well as for smaller-scale studies. Simulation of ATLAS requires many components, from the generators that simulate particle collisions to packages simulating the response of the various detectors and triggers. The latest developments in the saga of ATLAS simulation have been focussed on better representation of the real detector, based on first LHC data, and on performance improvements to ensure that event simulation is not a limiting factor in ATLAS physics analyses. The full process is constantly monitored and profiled to guarantee the best use of available resources without any degradation in the quality and accuracy of the simulation.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) in 2016 to prepare mission-relevant applications and scientific software for the delivery of the exascale computers starting in 2023. The ECP currently supports 24 efforts directed at specific applications and six supporting co-design projects. These 24 application projects contain 62 application codes that are implemented in three high-level languages---C, C++, and Fortran---and use 22 combinations of graphical processing unit programming models. The most common implementation language is C++, which is used in 53 different application codes. The most common programming models across ECP applications are CUDA and Kokkos, which are employed in 15 and 14 applications, respectively. This article provides a survey of the programming languages and models used in the ECP applications codebase that will be used to achieve performance on the future exascale hardware platforms.},

@article{Hamilton2022-Domain,
	abstract = {The GPU solver within the Shift continuous-energy Monte Carlo neutron transport code has been extended to provide domain decomposition in addition to domain replication to enable the solution of problems with memory requirements exceeding the capacity of a single GPU. The strategy follows the Multiple Set, Overlapping Domain (MSOD) approach that is used in Shift's CPU solver and integrates into the event-based algorithm used for Shift's GPU solver. Furthermore, the ability to assign processors to spatial domains non-uniformly has been maintained. Two different approaches for communicating particle data between domains are considered, and multiple criteria for load balancing problems have been investigated. Numerical results are presented for both fresh and depleted small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) cores. A parallel efficiency of approximately 80\% was achieved with up to 16 spatial domains measured relative to full domain replication. A scaling study on the Summit supercomputer demonstrates a weak scaling parallel efficiency of over 90\% on over 24000 GPUs.},

	abstract = {Particle physics has an ambitious and broad experimental programme for the coming decades. This programme requires large investments in detector hardware, either to build new facilities and experiments, or to upgrade existing ones. Similarly, it requires commensurate investment in the R\&D of software to acquire, manage, process, and analyse the shear amounts of data to be recorded. In planning for the HL-LHC in particular, it is critical that all of the collaborating stakeholders agree on the software goals and priorities, and that the efforts complement each other. In this spirit, this white paper describes the R\&D activities required to prepare for this software upgrade.},

@article{Hamilton2019-Continuous-energy,
	abstract = {A continuous-energy Monte Carlo neutron transport solver executing on GPUs has been developed within the Shift code. Several algorithmic approaches are considered, including both history-based and eventbased implementations. Unlike in previous work involving multigroup Monte Carlo transport, it is demonstrated that event-based algorithms significantly outperform a history-based approach for continuous-energy transport as a result of increased device occupancy and reduced thread divergence. Numerical results are presented for detailed full-core models of a small modular reactor (SMR), including a model containing depleted fuel materials. These results demonstrate the substantial gains in performance that are possible with the latest-generation of GPUs. On the depleted SMR core configuration, an NVIDIA P100 GPU with 56 streaming multiprocessors provides performance equivalent to 90 CPU cores, and the latest V100 GPU with 80 multiprocessors offers the performance of more than 150 CPU cores.},

	abstract = {Geant4 is a software toolkit for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter. It is used by a large number of experiments and projects in a variety of application domains, including high energy physics, astrophysics and space science, medical physics and radiation protection. Over the past several years, major changes have been made to the toolkit in order to accommodate the needs of these user communities, and to efficiently exploit the growth of computing power made available by advances in technology. The adaptation of Geant4 to multithreading, advances in physics, detector modeling and visualization, extensions to the toolkit, including biasing and reverse Monte Carlo, and tools for physics and release validation are discussed here.},
