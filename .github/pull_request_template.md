# Title

Should be an imperative statement (title-cased first word, no trailing punctuation) summarizing its effect on the user.  For example:
 - Implement the FooBar model
 - Handle errors in track initialization
 - Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons
 - Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type
 - Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions

# Description

The description should summarize or enumerate the main changes in the pull request. Illustrative images are recommended if possible!

# Labels

If you're a core developer, add one of each label:

- Change type: {bug, documentation, enhancement, minor}
- Category: {app, core, external, field, orange, performance, physics, user}

Some examples of labels are:
 - *Implement the FooBar model*: enhancement, physics
 - *Handle errors in track initialization*: enhancement, orange
 - *Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons*: bug, physics
 - *Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type*: minor, orange
 - *Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions*: enhancement, documentation

See [review process](https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas/blob/develop/doc/appendix/administration.rst#code-review) for descriptions of the labels and requirements.

# Draft status

The final button to push, "Create pull request", has an drop-down menu arrow
next to it that lets you change to "Draft pull request". Select this option if
you want to run further testing before beginning the review process.
