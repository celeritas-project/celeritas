# Title

Should be an imperative statement (title-cased first word, no trailing punctuation) summarizing its effect on the user.  For example:
 - Implement the FooBar model *[enhancement, physics]*
 - Handle errors in track initialization *[enhancement, orange]*
 - Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons *[bug, physics]*
 - Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type *[minor, orange]*
 - Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions *[enhancement, documentation]*

# Description

The description should summarize or enumerate the main changes in the pull request. Illustrative images are recommended if possible!

# Labels

If you're a core developer, add one of each label:

- Change type: {bug, documentation, enhancement, minor}
- Category: {app, core, external, field, orange, performance, physics, user}

See [review process](https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas/blob/develop/doc/appendix/administration.rst#code-review) for descriptions of the labels and requirements.
