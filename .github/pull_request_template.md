 - Handle errors in track initialization *[enhancement, orange]*
 - Fix sampling of low-energy Celeritons *[bug, physics]*
 - Refactor code in preparation for new tracker type *[minor, orange]*
 - Add CI support for multiple Geant4 versions *[enhancement, documentation]*

# Description

The description should summarize or enumerate the main changes in the pull request. Illustrative images are recommended if possible!

- Change type: {bug, documentation, enhancement, minor}
- Category: {app, core, external, field, orange, performance, physics, user}

See [https://github.com/celeritas-project/celeritas/blob/develop/doc/appendices/administration.rst#review-process](review process) for descriptions of the labels and requirements.
