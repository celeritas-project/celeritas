/*!
 * Create track initializers on device from secondary particles.
 *
 * Secondaries produced by each track are ordered arbitrarily in memory, and
 * the memory may be fragmented if not all secondaries survived cutoffs. For
 * example, after the interactions have been processed and cutoffs applied, the
 * track states and their secondaries might look like the following (where 'X'
 * indicates a track or secondary that did not survive):
 * \verbatim

   thread ID   | 0   1 2           3       4   5 6           7       8   9
   track ID    | 10  X 8           7       X   5 4           X       2   1
   secondaries | [X]   [X, 11, 12] [13, X] [X]   [14, X, 15] [X, 16] [X]

   \endverbatim
 *
 * Because the order in which threads receive a chunk of memory from the
 * secondary allocator is nondeterministic, the actual ordering of the
 * secondaries in memory is unpredictable; for instance:
 * \verbatim

  secondary storage | [X, 13, X, X, 11, 12, X, X, 16, 14, X, 15, X]

  \endverbatim
 *
 * When track initializers are created from secondaries, they are ordered by
 * thread ID to ensure reproducibility. If a track that produced secondaries
 * has died (e.g., thread ID 7 in the example above), one of its secondaries is
 * immediately used to fill that track slot:
 * \verbatim

   thread ID   | 0   1 2           3       4   5 6           7       8   9
   track ID    | 10  X 8           7       X   5 4           16      2   1
   secondaries | [X]   [X, 11, 12] [13, X] [X]   [14, X, 15] [X, X]  [X]

   \endverbatim
 *
 * This way, the geometry state is reused rather than initialized from the
 * position (which is expensive). This also prevents the geometry state from
 * being overwritten by another track's secondary, so if the track produced
 * multiple secondaries, the rest are still able to copy the parent's state.
 *
 * Track initializers are created from the remaining secondaries and are added
 * to the back of the vector. The thread ID of each secondary's parent is also
 * stored, so any new tracks initialized from secondaries produced in this
 * step can copy the geometry state from the parent. The indices of the empty
 * slots in the track vector are identified and stored as a sorted vector of
 * vacancies.
 * \verbatim

   track initializers | 11 12 13 14 15
   parent             | 2  2  3  6  6
   vacancies          | 1  4

   \endverbatim
