/*!
 * Exterior and interior CSG node bounding boxes.
 *
 * This class manages the "zone" enclosing a CSG region's boundary. It
 * partitions space into three concentric zones: "known inside" the region,
 * "maybe inside, maybe outside" the region, and "known outside" the region.
 *
 * \verbatim
 *  outside           ; inside
 *   +-------------+  ;  +-------------+
 *   | maybe   ..  |  ;  | maybe   ..  |
 *   |  .......  . |  ;  |  .......  . |
 *   | .+-----+ .  |  ;  | .+-----+ .  |
 *   | .| in  |  ..|  ;  | .| out |  ..|
 *   | .|     |   .|  ;  | .|     |   .|
 *   | .+-----+ .. |  ;  | .+-----+ .. |
 *   | ........    |  ;  | ........    |
 *   +-------------+  ;  +-------------+
 *                    ;
 *   negated = false  ;  negated = true
 * \endverbatim
 *
 * - Known outside is the typical bounding box case: nowhere outside the
 *   bounding box is inside the volume; i.e., the box completely encloses the
 *   volume (but may also enclose parts that *aren't* volume).
 * - Known inside can be used for safety distance calculation.
 * - Flipping the two cases when applying a "not" operator to a CSG node: so
 *   "known inside" becomes "known outside" and could potentially be flipped
 *   back in a subsequent simplification.
 *
 * The \c exterior box always encloses (or is identical to) \c interior in the
 * bounding zone.  The \c negated flag corresponds to taking the \em complement
 * of a closed CSG region.
 *
 * If \c negated is \c false, then the exterior box is what we
 * typically think of as a bounding box. If \c true, then even though the
 * exterior bounding box encloses interior box, *all points inside
 * the interior box are known to be outside the volume*.  Regardless of
 * negation, the area between the interior and exterior bounding boxes is \em
 * indeterminate: a point in that space may be within the CSG region, or it may
 * not.
 *
 * The behavior of boundaries (whether coincident boundary/shape should count
 * as being "interior" or "exterior") shouldn't matter because we will always
 * "bump" boundaries before using them for transport.
 *
 * The following table shows the semantics of set operations on the bounding
 * zones.  Below, \c ~zone means a zone with the \c negated flag set; \c ~box
 * means "complement of a bbox": all space *except*
 * inside box; and the union operator implies the (possibly disconnected and
 * probably not box-shaped!) union of the two boxes. \c A_i is the interior
 * (enclosed) box for A, and \c A_x is the exterior (enclosing) box.
 *
 * | Zone      | known inside   | known outside   |
 * | ------    | ------------   | -------------   |
 * | `A`       | `A_i`          | `~A_x`          |
 * | `~A`      | `~A_x`         | `A_i`           |
 * | `A & B`   | `A_i & B_i`    | `~(A_x & B_x)`  |
 * | `~A & B ` | `~A_x & B_i`   | `~(~A_i & B_x)` |
 * | `~A & ~B` | `~A_x & ~B_x`  | `~(~A_i & ~B_i)`|
 * | `A | B`   | `A_i | B_i`    | `~(A_x | B_x)`  |
 * | `~A | B ` | `~A_x | B_i`   | `~(~A_i | B_x)` |
 * | `~A | ~B` | `~A_x | ~B_x`  | `~(~A_i | ~B_i)`|
 *
 * The following set algebra can be used:
 * - Involution: \verbatim ~~A <=> A \endverbatim
 * - De Morgan's law 1: \verbatim ~A | ~B <=> ~(A & B) \endverbatim
 * - De Morgan's law 2:\verbatim ~A & ~B <=> ~(A | B) \endverbatim
 * - Set difference: \verbatim A & ~B <=> A - B \endverbatim
 * - Negated set difference: \verbatim A | ~B <=> ~(B - A) \endverbatim
 *
 * The default bounding zone is the empty set: nothing is inside, everything is
 * known outside.
