/*!
 * Abstract base class representing a physics model.
 *
 * A Model is a representation (often an approximation) to a physics process
 * such as Compton scattering that is valid for one or more particle types in a
 * given range (or ranges) of energy.
 *
 * Each Model subclass is constructed with a unique ModelId by a Process, which
 * is effectively a group of Models. Once constructed, it is essentially
 * immutable.
 *
 * The model assumes a few responsibilities:
 * - It provides accessors for the ranges of applicability: the same model
 *   (interaction kernel) can apply to multiple particles at different energy
 *   ranges.
 * - It precalculates macroscopic cross sections for each range of
 *   applicability.
 * - It precalculates energy loss rates and range limiters for each range.
 * - If it has an interaction cross section, it provides an "interact" method
 *   for undergoing an interaction and possibly emitting secondaries.
 *
 * This class is similar to Geant4's G4VContinuousDiscrete process, but more
 * limited.
