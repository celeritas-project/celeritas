# The cudatoolkit on Perlmutter is provided by NVHPC, which moved some CUDA headers to a "math_libs" directory (e.g., curand_kernel.h).
# If using Spack, this will cause a compile error in VecGeom+cuda.
# Spack uses this CUDA install as external CUDA package and doesn't look in the math_libs directory for extra headers.
# --> the fix for now is to unload these modules and install our own cudatoolkit using Spack.
